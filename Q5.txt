5. You are given a JavaScript object representing a student's information. task is to 
use the 'for...in' loop to iterate over the properties of the object and perform 
various operations.

const student = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 22,
    major: "Computer Science",
    GPA: 3.8,
    isEnrolled: true
};

// Iterate over the properties of the student object

for (let property in student) {

    // Check if the property is directly on the object and not inherited

    if (student.hasOwnProperty(property)) {

        // Perform various operations based on the property

        switch (property) {
            case "name":
                console.log("Student's name:", student[property]);
                break;
            case "age":
                console.log("Student's age:", student[property]);
                break;
            case "major":
                console.log("Student's major:", student[property]);
                break;
            case "GPA":
                console.log("Student's GPA:", student[property]);
                break;
            case "isEnrolled":
                console.log("Is student enrolled?", student[property] ? "Yes" : "No");
                break;
            default:
                console.log("Unknown property:", property);
        }
    }
}


Output:
	
	Student's name: Alice
	Student's age: 22
	Student's major: Computer Science
	Student's GPA: 3.8
	Is student enrolled? Yes


a. Create a function displayStudentInfo that takes the student object as a parameter. 
Inside this function, use a'for...in' loop to iterate over the properties of the 
student object and print each property and its corresponding value to the console. 
The output should look something like this:

const student = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 22,
    major: "Computer Science",
    GPA: 3.8,
    isEnrolled: true
};

function displayStudentInfo(student){
    // Iterate over the properties of the student object
    for (let property in student) {
        // Check if the property is directly on the object and not inherited
        if (student.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
            // Print the property and its corresponding value to the console
            console.log(`Property : ${property}, Value: ${student[property]}`);
        }
    }        
}

displayStudentInfo(student);
